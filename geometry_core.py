    one pass.

    The RULE IS UNCHANGED: within each contiguous True-run of `field` down a
    column, fill from that run's first band-hit row through the end of the run.
    Implementation: label each contiguous field run down a column (`segid`), take
    the minimum band-hit row within each (segment, column) via `np.minimum.at`,
    then keep the field cells at or below their segment's first hit. `big` (= n)
    is the "no hit in this segment" sentinel, so segments without a hit stay
    empty exactly as the per-column version leaves them.

    Formulation: a cell is filled iff it is field AND at least one band-hit has
    occurred at-or-above it WITHIN its own contiguous run. Let c = cumulative
    count of hits down the column. For a run beginning at row s, the number of
    hits inside the run at-or-above row r is c[r] - c_excl[s], where c_excl[s] is
    the hit count strictly above s. Because run starts move downward and c_excl is
    non-decreasing, `np.maximum.accumulate` of "c_excl at run starts, -1 elsewhere"
    propagates each run's baseline to its own rows. This uses only cumsum and
    maximum.accumulate (fast C reductions) — no `np.minimum.at`, which is an
    unbuffered scatter and was itself a major cost.

    On a merged slope, a repair cascade must fan into the OPEN roof field -- inside the
    merged facet and OUTSIDE every excluded region. An excluded region is any hole in the
    repair field: a dormer, a courtyard, a chimney chase, a mechanical well, a cluster of
    skylights -- they are ALL treated identically here. The rule never asks what created a
    hole; it only asks which side of the valley leads to open field.

    Determined as PURE GEOMETRY, before any affected_area/cascade runs:
      1. Adjacency: if exactly one side within `band` of the valley is blocked (inside an
         excluded region or outside the facet), fan to the clear side.
      2. Otherwise, fan toward the side whose LOCAL open field (up the fall line, within
         `reach`, inside facet and outside all excluded regions) is larger -- the connected
         repair region, not merely the nearest hole.
      3. If both sides are geometrically symmetric, mark ambiguous and fall back
         deterministically toward the facet centroid x.

    Returns +1 (fan toward +x in the frame) or -1. Independent of cascade fragmentation.
