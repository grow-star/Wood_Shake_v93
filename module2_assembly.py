# CHANGELOG 2026-07-04: notch valley set now selection-driven (override_valley_ids); fallback preserves anchor 3691.
# CHANGELOG 2026-06-29 (Phase-2 re-baseline 3709->3691 EA / 1645.6->1638.0 SF):
#   Consistent clipped penetration exclusion across single/multi/notch paths,
#   dimensional-only (footprint >= 0.5 SF carves; point < 0.5 SF lays over).
#   - multi path: no longer include_child_penetrations flag-gated; always passes
#     dimensional penetrations to affected_area's existing clipped exclusion.
#   - notch path: now carves member-facet dimensional penetrations (frame-transformed).
#   - dedup-as-subsumed-event: in-field appurtenance (host is a confirmed repair facet)
#     contributes flashing/IWS only, 0 double-counted field shakes.
#   Prior multi/notch skipped the exclusion the single path already ran; only F70
#   (in-zone chimney on F4) moves the total. See module1_yager_proof.py.
"""Full-roof Module 2 assembly with physical shared-edge deduplication.

Assembly/translation only. Frozen expand_scope remains the material-rule engine;
this layer prevents physical edges shared by two in-scope facets from being
scoped twice by unioning contact by XML line id before one final edge-only
expand_scope call.

# ================================ RIDGE VENTS ================================
# A RIDGE VENT IS NOT A REPAIR EVENT. Marking a ridge vented creates NO affected area, NO carve, NO
# shading and NO new repair event. It changes NOTHING about EA, SF, the shake count or the diagram's
# affected zones. It is a MATERIAL ITEM on a ridge run that is ALREADY IN SCOPE: ridge caps only bill
# where the affected area from the user's EXISTING repairs contacts the ridge (contact_LF > 0), and a
# vent only changes WHAT MATERIAL goes on that already-contacted run.
#
# THE TWO TYPES BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY (Joseph — binding):
#   SHINGLE-OVER = an ACCESSORY. The cap shakes lay OVER the vent, so the ridge STILL GETS ITS FULL
#                  CAPS. It ADDS a line and takes nothing away:   RIDGE_VENT = V, RIDGE_CAPS = C.
#   ALUMINUM     = a SUBSTITUTION. It is self-capping, so it REPLACES the caps on its own run:
#                                                                 RIDGE_VENT = V, RIDGE_CAPS = C - V.
# Modelling shingle-over as a substitution would silently DELETE caps the job actually needs.
#
# THE VENTED LF IS A USER INPUT. A vent may cover only part of a ridge, and we do not know WHERE on
# the ridge it sits, so V is defined as "the vent LF being replaced WITHIN THIS REPAIR". That
# sidesteps the positional problem and puts the judgement with the person looking at the roof.
