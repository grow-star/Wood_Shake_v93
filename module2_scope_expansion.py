MODULE 2 — SCOPE EXPANSION ENGINE  +  SEED REGRESSION
=====================================================
The missing Module 2 implementation. Module 1 (regression_test.py, v3.3, GREEN)
computes geometry; THIS turns that frozen geometry into the quantified material/
labor line list. Built to Module 2 Scope Expansion Spec v1.2 (§2 rule table).

BOUNDARY (Architecture v1.5 / Module 2 §0):
  - Reads the Module 1 interface; NEVER measures geometry.
  - Does all quantity math; no pricing, no replacement escalation, no report.
  - Source-agnostic: same rules whether a value came from EagleView or a user-
    placed event — Module 2 only sees the interface numbers.

REGRESSION INTEGRITY:
  Every expected number in the seed suite traces to a value the GREEN Module 1
  suite already asserts, or to a locked study-sheet area. No invented inputs.
  Facet D is a COMPLETE single-facet fixture (every line traceable):
    area 28.2 SF (GREEN test 3) ; eave 2.00 ; ridge 6.32/6.56=96% ; hip
    2.62/4.04=65% ; rake 0.00 ; valley L4 edge 7.74 ft (XML).
  Plus the green Yager facets (N/R, dormer-outside L4/L5, L, M, V-J, V-E, V full,
  P chimney), each asserted ONCE from green-traceable totals, and the synthetic
  rule guards (94/96 boundary, transition fire/no-fire, grouping, informational,
  repair_factor) per Module 2 §12.

  This is a SEED suite (Module 2 §12 discipline: seed then grow). Growing to all
  20 valley-sides = feeding each remaining facet's GREEN-frozen interface in as
  another snapshot; the engine logic does not change.

    "harmonize" the two paths): Path A's >=95%-sweep inference — "the flashing was torn out" — has been
    producing Joseph's filed numbers for ninety versions, and reversing it would move the Yager anchor from
    15 lines to 14. That is a separate decision from adding a fact, and v91 deliberately did not take it.
    Path R (a replaced slope, v92) is NEW scope: nothing is being preserved, so it starts correct, and
    inventing a flashing line on a roof where nobody said metal exists is the error this whole sequence has
    been fixing. (Path B is itself the EXPOSED answer — the data layer only creates it from EXPOSED + damaged.)

    UNKNOWN behaves EXACTLY as never-asked (v92 flip, Joseph 2026-10-26): answering "not sure" must not
