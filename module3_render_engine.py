    #      the shake analysis and the diagram (§4) are computed from the PAGE 2 ROOF SELECTION. No
    #      carrier estimate is involved in producing them. If a carrier-side condition can suppress
    #      them, the design is wrong. Verified on v58: bypassing this line rendered ALL EIGHT
    #      sections with 15 material lines already sitting in M2.required_lines, unused.

    #      "the same category appears twice in one estimate" — a normal Xactimate Remove/Additional
    #      pair. Fixed at source; that status is now raised ONLY for the true multi-ESTIMATE case.
