MODULE 3 — REPORT PROTOTYPE RENDERER  (first template)
======================================================
Turns the §3.1 section projection into a professional, standardized HTML report.
This is PRESENTATION ONLY — it adds no logic, no calculation, no state assignment.
It consumes the already-projected section data from the proven, contract-obeying
reference renderer (`render()` in module3_render_engine), so it
cannot drift from the §3.1 read-map. Sample data is the existing seed oracle.

Scope guards honored: no fancy visual design, no new logic/calc, no F9, no
Authority Library / code automation, no policy interpretation. Module 1/2, the
parser, and the comparison builder are imported/frozen — not modified.

Outputs: module3_report_sample_comparison.html
